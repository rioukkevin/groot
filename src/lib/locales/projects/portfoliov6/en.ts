    "This website represents a previous version of my portfolio, which was online for two years until October 2024. Designed in 2022, its main objective was to capture the attention of recruiters for a full-time position. This version reflects an important stage in my professional journey, highlighting my skills and experience at that time.",
    "The essence of this portfolio was based on simplicity and minimalism. I deliberately opted for a clean design, allowing visitors to focus on the essentials: my work and skills. This approach aimed to offer a smooth and pleasant user experience while effectively showcasing my achievements.",
    "On the technical side, I paid particular attention to performance and SEO. This approach had a dual purpose: firstly, to deepen my knowledge in these crucial areas of web development, and secondly, to optimize the user experience, especially on mobile devices. The result was a fast, responsive, and well-referenced site, demonstrating my technical skills and attention to detail.",
    "A unique feature of this portfolio was the inclusion of endorsements for professional projects close to my heart. Among them were initiatives like https://www.poachiclash.com/, a video game tournament, as well as the promotion of products from an Alsatian artisan. These personal recommendations not only illustrated my professional network but also my varied interests and commitment to local and innovative projects.",
    "One of the most stimulating technical challenges of this project was developing a translation system from scratch. This initiative allowed me to explore in depth the workings of many existing translation packages. This process not only enriched my technical skills but also offered me a deep understanding of localization mechanisms, a valuable asset for international projects.",
    "For content management, I opted for Storyblok, a modern headless CMS. This decision was motivated by my desire to experiment with cutting-edge content management solutions. Integrating Storyblok allowed me to gain flexibility in content updates and acquire valuable experience that I could later leverage in my freelance missions. This approach demonstrated my ability to adopt and master new technologies to improve the efficiency and maintainability of web projects.",
