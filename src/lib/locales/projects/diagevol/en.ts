    "As part of my full-time employment, I had the exciting opportunity to develop the showcase website diagevol.fr. Starting from partial mockups, I took on the challenge of bringing this crucial project for the company to life. This experience allowed me to put my web development skills into practice while adapting to the specific constraints and expectations of the project.",
    "Diagevol is much more than just a website. It's the digital showcase for an innovative product from Alpha8, a revolutionary SaaS solution in the field of questionnaires and diagnostics. The site clearly and attractively presents Diagevol's unique features, such as creating customized questionnaires, automatic analysis of responses, and generation of professional reports. The goal was to highlight how Diagevol can transform the way companies collect and analyze data, thus offering a powerful tool for decision-making.",
    "The development of this site was a stimulating adventure, blending creativity and technical skill. I had the responsibility of creating the graphics and developing the majority of the site autonomously. Faced with a tight deadline, I had to demonstrate agility and pragmatism, prioritizing the essential modules of the site while keeping in mind the business objectives. This experience allowed me to develop not only my technical skills but also my understanding of the business challenges related to the development of digital products.",
