    "Outrans Counter is an innovative mobile website, specially designed for the Outrans association on the occasion of their 15th anniversary. Faced with the challenge of limited capacity, this application offers volunteers a counter synchronized across multiple devices, allowing for smooth and precise management of entries during this important event.",
    "With security being a priority, I developed a lightweight but effective access system. Through the use of hashed codes, only authorized individuals can access the application, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of event data.",
    "To go beyond simple counting, I integrated custom scripts to generate detailed statistics. This feature provides the association with valuable insights into the event's progress, contributing to better understanding and planning for future events.",
