    "A VSCode extension to template commit message in the IDE VSCode",
  descriptions: [
    "VSCode Git Commit is an innovative extension designed to simplify and standardize the creation of Git commit messages directly within the VSCode development environment. This extension provides an intuitive interface allowing developers to generate structured and consistent commit messages, thus improving the readability and management of project history.",
    "The idea for this extension was born from my experience in the corporate world, where I noticed that each developer had their own way of writing commit messages. This disparity often made it difficult to understand the project's history. VSCode Git Commit aims to solve this problem by offering a uniform framework for writing messages, thus facilitating collaboration and tracking of changes.",
    "I am particularly proud of the success this extension has achieved. With over 40 stars on GitHub and more than 20,000 downloads, it has clearly found its audience within the developer community. These numbers testify to the utility and relevance of the tool in the workflow of many professionals.",
    "Following positive feedback and user suggestions after the first version, I decided to go further by creating a dedicated website. This site offers a configuration generator with a user-friendly interface, allowing developers to easily customize their commit templates. Additionally, I set up a web version of the documentation, making the use of the extension even more accessible and practical.",
    "Although the development of this extension is currently on hold, it's to better rebound towards an even more ambitious project. I'm working on a new tool that will not only replace VSCode Git Commit but will extend its functionalities to multiple platforms. The goal is to create a universal solution with a single, more flexible configuration file, thus meeting the varied needs of developers across different work environments.",
