    "Welcome to version 5 of my portfolio, an exciting creation from 2021! It's a true journey through time, allowing you to explore a key stage in my professional journey. This version, which you are currently browsing, reflects my evolution and creativity at that time.",
    "This portfolio was designed with a very specific goal: to present my projects and experiences accumulated over time in a captivating way. It was my digital business card, specially created for my recruitment process at Brioche Pasquier. Each element was carefully chosen to showcase my skills and potential.",
    "Beyond its presentation function, this project was a fantastic field of experimentation for me. I challenged myself to push the limits of CSS animations, exploring advanced techniques to create a truly unique user experience. This approach allowed me not only to improve my technical skills but also to discover my own ability to innovate and solve complex problems.",
    "The technical evolution of this portfolio is just as fascinating as its content. Initially hosted on a Docker machine, it was then migrated to Netlify, and finally to Vercel. This progression reflects my constant quest for performance optimization and simplification of the deployment process, thus ensuring an increasingly smooth and responsive user experience.",
