  descriptions: [
    "Controller overlays are an exciting project that I occasionally undertake to support streamers on Twitch. It's a way for me to contribute to the community by adding visual value to their streams.",
    "These overlays are designed dynamically, offering viewers a real-time representation of the movements made by the streamer while playing. This interactivity adds an extra dimension to the viewing experience, allowing viewers to better understand and appreciate the player's skills.",
    "Technically, these overlays are an ingenious assembly of images animated via JavaScript. This approach allows for great flexibility and advanced customization, tailored to the specific needs of each streamer.",
    "For Dgifou, I created a unique and custom overlay, meticulously respecting his graphic charter. This attention to detail ensures visual consistency with his channel's identity, thus reinforcing his brand image.",
    "The project for Amphirae evolved over time. I first designed a PS4 version, then a PS5 version, thus accompanying her hardware evolution. This adaptation demonstrates my ability to evolve my creations according to the changing needs of streamers.",
    "The case of Oxidya_ perfectly illustrates the advanced customization I can offer. After an initial general version, I developed specific versions for each of the games she streams daily. This tailored approach considerably enriches the visual experience of her streams, making them unique and immersive.",
